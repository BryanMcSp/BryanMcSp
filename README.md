# Bryan Andrew McSpadden
## I am a student at The University of Texas at Austin interested in Clinical Psychology, specifically the areas of Anxiety and Depression, as well as Data Science. 

I am originally from Amarillo, Texas but I moved to Austin (More specifically Cedar Park) when I was around six years old. Ever since then I have fallen in love with Austin, and ended up fulfilling a lifelong dream when I got accepted into UT. I am excited to continue my path through the world of Psychology, and I want use whatever tools available to help those who are unable to help themselves. My current goal is to become a licensed clinical psychologist who devotes their time both to research and practice. I hope to one day help normalize the conversation around mental health, and provide easily accessible treatment to those struggling everyday with mental illness.
